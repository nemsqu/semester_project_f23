Backend instructions
==========

This is the backend code for the fall 2023 semester project (QR scanner) and is built using Node.js and Mongoose (MongoDB).


Usage
------
To start the backend server, copy the code to a folder of your choice and in that folder run the command `node.js start` or `node app.js`. 

To retrieve data from the database there are `GET` api routes for each table. These can be found from _index.js_.
